#Returns a dataframe containing Cues, Outcomes, and Frequency.

#  1. It takes as an input 'myexp'--csv file containing labels, affixes, and frequencies.

#If condition is "suffix": object labels will serve as cues and affixes will serve as outcomes.
#If condition is "prefix": object labels will serve as outcomes and affixes will serve as cues (prefix condition).
