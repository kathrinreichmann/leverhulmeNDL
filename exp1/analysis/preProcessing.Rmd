```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls());
```

Set your local working directory. This should be (and is assumed to be in the rest of the code) the highest point in your local folder:
```{r}
localGitDir <- 'C:/Users/eva_v/Documents/GitHub/leverhulmeNDL/exp1'
setwd(localGitDir);
```
```{r load stimuli set}
fribbleSet <- read.csv(paste(localGitDir, "/stimuli/stimuli.csv", sep = ""), header = T);
```

## Check stimuli set
It's important to check that every fribble is unique in the way its features are assembled within each category.
Feature position and identity are coded into cueID.

```{r check for duplicates}
kableExtra::kable(table(fribbleSet$cueID, fribbleSet$category))
```

Great, each fribble is a unique.
